Hey! I am Greer Handley, and this is my hub for all of my classwork throughout my Computational Biology course at LA Tech.
All of the code below was created following step-by-step instructions as a way to become familiar with Python and its applications.

%matplotlib inline
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns 
sns.set(style="darkgrid")
