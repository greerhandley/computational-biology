# Computational Biology
Hey! I am Greer Handley, and this is my hub for all of my classwork throughout my Computational Biology course at LA Tech.
All of the code below was created following step-by-step instructions as a way to become familiar with Python and its applications.

# Using Jupyter Notebooks (1 and 2)
%matplotlib inline
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
sns.set(style= "darkgrid")

# Python Fundamentals


# Analyzing Data (1, 2, and 3)


# Storing Values in Lists


# Using Loops


# Using Multiple Files


# Making Choices


# Functions (1, 2, 3, and 4)


# Errors


# Defensive Programming


# Command Line Programs


# Transcribing DNA into RNA


# Translating RNA into Protein
